How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Kylacoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `kylacoind`/`kylacoin-qt` (on Linux).

Notable changes
===============
- Disallow custom transaction versions.
- Chain parameters have been updated according to mainnet and testnet chains.
- More DNS seeds have been added for faster synchronization.
